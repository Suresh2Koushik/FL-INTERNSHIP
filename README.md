# FL-INTERNSHIP
<h2> Summer Research Internship- Federated learning </h2>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<p>

  <h4> Learning experience in the internship </h4>
  
• In Machine Learning, where we perform analysis by bringing the client’s
data into centralised server and then we train the model based on our
preferences. By this approach we understand the privacy and security of
the data is been accessed by many unauthorised users from all over the
world.

• In order to overcome the above issue, we come up with technique
known as Federated Learning. FL trains an algorithm across multiple
decentralized edge devices or servers holding client’s local data records,
without exchanging them.


• It enables multiple clients to build a common learning model without
sharing data, that allows to address the critical issues such as data
privacy, data security, data access rights and access to heterogeneous
data.

  <h4> PADHAI – Deep Learning </h4>
 
• This platform helped  to understand Deep Learning concepts by which
we have learnt about MP Neuron, Perceptron, Sigmoid Neuron, Gradient
Descent, Feedforward Neural Networks, Optimization Algorithms and
PyTorch.

<h4> UDEMY </h4>

•This platform helped us to understand about federated learning.

• In this course, I have learnt about the main concepts in Neural
Networks (NN) and how they work. 

•Then I have implemented Neural Networks from scratch using PyTorch. After that, we have
moved on to Federated Learning architecture.

• Later, I started it by loading the dataset on the devices in IID,
non-IID, and non-IID and unbalanced settings.

• With the help of PySyft, we learnt how to send and receive the
models and the datasets between the clients and the server.

• We have implemented some federated learning algorithms such as
FedAvg, FedSGD, FedProx, and FedDANE. Next, we learned
about Differential Privacy (DP) and how to add it to FL.

  <h4> Youtube resource </h4>
 
• With the help of YouTube tutorials and official documentation we
have learnt about the PyTorch and its importance.

• PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library for Python and
is completely based on Torch. It is primarily used for applications
such as natural language processing.
