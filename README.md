# FL-INTERNSHIP
<h2> Summer Research Internship- Federated learning </h2>

  <h4> Learning experience in the internship </h4>
  
In Machine Learning, where we perform analysis by bringing the client’s
data into centralised server and then we train the model based on our
preferences. By this approach we understand the privacy and security of
the data is been accessed by many unauthorised users from all over the
world.

In order to overcome the above issue, we come up with technique
known as Federated Learning. FL trains an algorithm across multiple
decentralized edge devices or servers holding client’s local data records,
without exchanging them.


It enables multiple clients to build a common learning model without
sharing data, that allows to address the critical issues such as data
privacy, data security, data access rights and access to heterogeneous
data.
